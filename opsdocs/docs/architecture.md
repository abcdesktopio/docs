```


1. User login, get a user JWT
2. Create a user POD and get a Desktop JWT
3. User is connecting to his own POD

	- All JWT are signed with RSA keys. 
	- All desktop's JWT payload are encrypted with another RSA keys

## Services Infrastructure

The service infrastructure is based on :

- Router nginx with lua script
- Website [Nginx container](/core/nginx)
- Database service [MongoDB](/core/mongodb/)
- Memcached service [Memcached](/core/memcached/)
- Pyos Core service (abcdesktop engine) [Pyos](/core/pyos/)

The user creates a pod [user](/core/user)


## Roles summary

### pyos

`pyos` is the core abcdesktop service act as a control plane. Pyos is a stateless services, Pyos's roles are :

- Authenticate user on authenticate providers
 - OAuth 2.0 Provider : Google, Facebook, Orange
 - LDAP and LDAPS
 - Active Directory
 - Anonymous (no auth)
- Start/Stop user's Pod in Kubernetes 
- Start/Stop user's applications as `ephemeral container` or as `pod`

> When a new user is authenticated, a dedicated user pod is created.
> 
> When the user starts an application (like LibreOffice for example) a dedicated container is created.


### Router

`router` pod act as a `http router` web server. It routes HTTP requets to `user's pods`, `web site`, or `pyos`.

### WebSite

`website` pod act as web server and delivers `html`, `javascript`, `svg` files. 

### mongo
`mongo` is used by pyos to store user profil informations. 
The profil informations are :

- Login history
- Dock configuration
- Image and background color configuration 


### memcached
`memcache` stores progress text message information during login process. `memcache` datas are set and get only by the control plane.


### oc.user
[`oc.user`](https://github.com/abcdesktopio/oc.user) is the name of the user's container image. `oc.user` runs the X11 graphical service. `oc.user` is based on ubuntu distribution. 

* The image `abcdesktopio/oc.user.ubuntu:4.1` is based on `ubuntu` distribution `24.04`. Get more details about [oc.user](https://github.com/abcdesktopio/oc.user) image.


### applications
All applications are `ephemeral containers` or `pods`, and share a graphical socket ( `unix` or `tcp` ) with the user's pod.
