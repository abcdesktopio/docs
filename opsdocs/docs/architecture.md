# Architecture in docker mode


##Â abcdesktop workflow (with LDAP Auth)


![Create POD process](img/createPod.png)

1. User login, get a user JWT
2. Create a user POD (or a container) and retrieve a Desktop JWT
3. Run, the user is connected to his own POD (or container)

	- All JWT are signed with RSA keys. 
	- All JWT payload are encrypted with RSA keys

## Services Infrastructure

The service infrastructure is based on :

- WebServer [Nginx container](/core/nginx)
- Database service [MongoDB](/core/mongodb/)
- Memcached service [Memcached](/core/memcached/)
- Pyos Core service (abcdesktop engine) [Pyos](/core/pyos/)

The user creates a pod [user](/core/user)


## Roles summary
