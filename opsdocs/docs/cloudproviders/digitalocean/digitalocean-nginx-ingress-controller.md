# Publish your website as a public secured service


## Requirements


- read the previous chapter [deploy abcdesktop on DigitalOcean with Kubernetes](digitalocean) 
- a DigitalOcean account
- a domain of you own hosted on digitalocean
- `doctl` command line interface [doctl cli](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/)
- `kubectl` command line
- `wget` command line

### To get more informations

- read the digital ocean chapter [install-nginx-ingress-controller](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/getting-started/operational-readiness/install-nginx-ingress-controller/)

## Overview

In this chapter we are going to, use a `nginx-ingress-controller` to host your abcdesktop service with a public IP Address, then configure dns zone file to use your own domain name, and activate TLS to secure your service.

## Install the NGINX Ingress Controller using the digitalocean's marketplace

Navigate to your cluster in the Kubernetes section of the digitalocean's console, then click to the Marketplace tab. In the recommended apps section, select `NGINX Ingress Controller` and then click Install.

![nginx-ingress-controller-marketplace](img/nginx-ingress-controller-market.png)

When installed, the app appears in the History of Installed 1-Click Apps section of the tab.

![nginx-ingress-controller-installing](img/nginx-ingress-controller-installing.png)

Verify if the `NGINX Ingress` Pods are up and running:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```

The output looks similar to the following

```
NAMESPACE       NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-controller-84b84685c5-2zvnz   1/1     Running   0          63s
ingress-nginx   ingress-nginx-controller-84b84685c5-vr9nl   1/1     Running   0          63s
```


Installing the `NGINX Ingress Controller` 1-Click App also creates a load balancer that you can see in the Resources tab of your cluster.

Run the following command to get the ID of the load balancer:

```
doctl compute load-balancer list --format IP,ID,Name,Status
```

The output looks similar to the following:

```
IP                ID                                      Name                                Status
129.212.134.86    39b2f24c-1a0e-46b6-9421-a3f033b168d7    a2744cf144c7d4d978c3fe7af00042fd    active
```

Keep in mind the IP Address of your `load-balancer`. In my case, the load-balancer gets the IP Address `129.212.134.86`


## Update your DNS zone file 


We will associate your `FQDN` (Fully Qualified Domain Name) to the load-balancer's IP Address.

![digitalocean networking](img/digitalocean-networking.png)

This screenshot describes the DigitalOcean network console. It shows the `Domain` informations, but you can manage your own zone file from your own registrar.

### Create new record

In this example, we are going to create a new record `hello` (`hello.digitalocean.pepins.net`) to the `A` address `129.212.134.86`. This IP Address is the `load-balancer` IP Address.

> You need to replace the hostname, the domain name and the IP Address with your own values.

Open your digital ocean console, and choose `networking/domains` 

Create Record in the [networking domains console](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/domains)

Map your hostname like `hello.digitalocean.pepins.net` to the ip address `129.212.134.86`. 
You need to replace the hostname, the domain name and the IP Address with your own values.

![digital ocean console domain overview](img/createrecordingress.png)

Press `Create Record` button, to update your zone file with the new record.



## Configure NGINX Ingress Rules for Backend Services 

In this step, you expose the backend applications to the outside world by telling nginx what host each service maps to. You define a rule in nginx to associate a host to a abcdesktop route backend service.

Create an ingress resource for NGNIX using the abcdesktop service and save it as `abcdesktop_host.yaml`
You need to update this manifest with your own FQDN, replace `hello.digitalocean.pepins.net` by your own values.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-abcdesktop
  namespace: abcdesktop
spec:
  rules:
    - host: hello.digitalocean.pepins.net
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: http-route
                port:
                  number: 80
  ingressClassName: nginx
```

Apply the Ingress yaml file

```
kubectl apply -f abcdesktop_host.yaml -n abcdesktop
```

You should read

```
ingress.networking.k8s.io/ingress-abcdesktop created
```


Verify the ingress resources:

```
kubectl get ingress -n abcdesktop
```

The output looks similar to the following:

Wait fee seconds while the `ADDRESS` field is empty  
```
NAME                 CLASS   HOSTS                           ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
ingress-abcdesktop   nginx   hello.digitalocean.pepins.net             80      24s
```

When you obtain an `IP ADDRESS`

```
NAME                 CLASS   HOSTS                           ADDRESS          PORTS   AGE
ingress-abcdesktop   nginx   hello.digitalocean.pepins.net   129.212.134.86   80      3m13s
```


The spec section of the manifest contains a list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend service. The manifest has the following fields:

- host specifies the fully qualified domain name of a network host, for example echo.<your-domain-name>.

- http contains the list of HTTP selectors pointing to backends.

- paths provides a collection of paths that map requests to backends.

In the example above, the ingress resource tells nginx to route each HTTP request that is using the / prefix for the `hello.digitalocean.pepins.net` host, to the `route` backend service running on port 80. In other words, every time you make a call to http://hello.digitalocean.pepins.net/, the request and reply are served by the echo backend service running on port 80.

You can have multiple ingress controllers per cluster. The ingressClassName field in the manifest differentiates between multiple ingress controllers present in your cluster. Although you can define multiple rules for different hosts and paths in a single ingress resource.

### Install Cert-Manager using the digitalocean's marketplace

Navigate to your cluster in the Kubernetes section of the control panel, then click the Marketplace tab. 

![certmanager](img/certmanager-market.png)

In the recommended apps section, select Cert-Manager and click Install.

![certmanager-installing](img/certmanager-installing.png)

When installed, the app appears in the History of Installed 1-Click Apps section of the tab.

Inspect the Kubernetes resources created by Cert-Manager:

```
kubectl get all -n cert-manager
```

The output looks similar to the following

```
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

The cert-manager pods and webhook service are running.

Cert-Manager creates custom resource definitions (CRDs). Cert-Manager relies on three important CRDs to issue certificates from a Certificate Authority (such as Letâ€™s Encrypt):

- Issuer: Defines a namespaced certificate issuer, which allows you to use different CAs in each namespace.

- ClusterIssuer: Similar to Issuer, but it does not belong to a namespace and can be used to issue certificates in any namespace.

- Certificate: Defines a namespaced resource that references an Issuer or ClusterIssuer for issuing certificates.

Inspect the CRDs by running the following command:

```
kubectl get crd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cert-manager
```

The output looks similar to the following

```
NAME                                  CREATED AT

```


### Configure Production-Ready TLS Certificates for nginx

You can issue the certificate using an Issuer. Configure a certificate issuers resource for Cert-Manager, which fetches the TLS certificate for nginx to use. The certificate issuer uses the HTTP-01 challenge provider to accomplish this task.

Create the following manifest, replace `<your-valid-email-address>` with your own value, and save it as cert-manager-issuer.yaml :

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-nginx
spec:
  acme:
    email: <your-valid-email-address>
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-nginx-private-key
    solvers:
      # Use the HTTP-01 challenge provider
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
```

The ACME issuer configuration has the following fields:

- email: Email address to be associated with the ACME account.
- server: URL used to access the ACME serverâ€™s directory endpoint.
- privateKeySecretRef: Kubernetes secret to store the automatically generated ACME account private key.

The ingress resources use the HTTP-01 challenge.

```
kubectl apply -f cert-manager-issuer.yaml -n abcdesktop
```

The output looks similar to the following

```
issuer.cert-manager.io/letsencrypt-nginx created
```

Verify that the Issuer resource is created:

```
kubectl get issuer -n abcdesktop         
```

The output looks similar to the following

```
NAME                READY   AGE
letsencrypt-nginx   True    7s
```


Next, configure each nginx ingress resource to use TLS. Open the previous `abcdesktop_host.yaml` manifest you created previously for the route application, add the `annotations` and `tls` sections shown below, and save the `abcdesktop_host.yaml` file:
You can also add dedicated `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io` annotations to increase default timeout values.
Replace `hello.digitalocean.pepins.net` by own FQDN

```
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-abcdesktop
  annotations:
   cert-manager.io/issuer: letsencrypt-nginx
   nginx.org/client-max-body-size: "256M"
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout: "30"
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "1800"
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "1800"
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "256M"
spec:
  tls:
   - hosts:
     - hello.digitalocean.pepins.net
     secretName: letsencrypt-nginx-echo
  rules:
    - host: hello.digitalocean.pepins.net
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: http-router
                port:
                  number: 80
  ingressClassName: nginx
```

Run the following command to configure the hosts to use TLS:

```
kubectl apply -f abcdesktop_host.yaml -n abcdesktop
```

After a few minutes, check the state of the ingress object:

```
kubectl get ingress -n  abcdesktop
NAME                 CLASS   HOSTS                           ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
ingress-abcdesktop   nginx   hello.digitalocean.pepins.net   129.212.134.86   80, 443   31m
```

Check that the certificate resource is created

```
kubectl get certificates -n abcdesktop
```

The output looks similar to the following

```
NAME                     READY   SECRET                   AGE
letsencrypt-nginx-echo   True    letsencrypt-nginx-echo   27m
```

Run a simple curl command line `curl -Li https://hello.digitalocean.pepins.net/` to confirm that your secured abcdesktop service is running.
