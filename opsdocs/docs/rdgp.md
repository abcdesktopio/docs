Privacy Notice: protecting your personal data

The changes to the French and European regulation on the protection of personal data come into force on 25 May 2018.

If you want to interact with abcdesktop via www.abcdesktop.io and other corporate sites, personal data will be collected about you in order to process your request and/or send you the desired information.

In this case, abcdesktop is committed to the protection, confidentiality and security of personal data.

This Privacy Notice provides information on how abcdesktop, and its potential subcontractors or partners, process your personal data in this context.

This document may be supplemented by specific information in the case of a specific service where appropriate (e.g. shareholders club) or in a commercial context. If you are an abcdesktop customer, you will also find a dedicated personal data protection policy on the website demo.abcdesktop.io.


Why does abcdesktop process your personal data collected on abcdesktop.io and on its corporate websites?
On demo.abcdesktop.io, you can ask a question or receive specific abcdesktop information (for example a press release). abcdesktop processes the personal data collected via the contact forms in place for these purposes. Some websites may require additional information which is processed specifically to enable access to a private or dedicated space, such as shareholders club.

We only process your personal data once we have your consent in the context of you request. 

Your data is only kept for the length of time needed to fulfil your request. This takes into account your unsubscription to certain newsletters or sending out press releases.


What types of data are processed?
abcdesktop may be required to process your personal data which we collect directly via the online form. It includes identity data, such as your name, surname, email address and sometimes your telephone number and postal address if necessary. 


Who can see your data?
Data collected about you is intended for abcdesktop’s internal services and if any, service providers.
In the case of a legal procedure, processed data may also be communicated to the relevant authorities.


Is your data processed outside the European Union?
The data collected may be processed outside the European Union if deemed necessary and according to the nature of your request. In this case, abcdesktop will take all necessary steps to protect your data. 


What are your rights?
You have the right to withdraw your consent and stop any future use of your data.
You can exercise your right to obtain information and access to the data, to rectify them in case of inaccurate data related to you and to delete the data when conditions are fulfilled.

Possibility to make a request to the Data protection authority, the CNIL in France:
If your interaction with abcdesktop is not satisfactory, you can also lodge a complaint with the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), which is the regulatory authority in charge of personal data protection in France.


How is your data secured?
Orange ensures your data remains secure and confidential, including certain processing carried out by subprocessor.

For this purpose, the appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to prevent the loss, misuse, alteration and deletion of your personal data. These measures are adapted according to the level of sensitivity of this processed data and the level of risk that the processing or implementation of it presents.
